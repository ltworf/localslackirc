localslackirc (1.31-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Due to changes in Debian, the default state directory is being moved from
  /var/tmp to /var/lib/localslackirc.
  If you want to preserve the status, stop the localslackirc service and move
  the status files to the new location, then start the service.

localslackirc (1.7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  To simplify running several instances of localslackirc, a new systemd
  service is provided.
  There is a main service called localslackirc.service, that does nothing but
  group all the instances.
  Instances are called with localslackirc@instance_name and require a file
  named in the same way in /etc/localslackirc.d
  This file acts like a configuration file and defines environment variables
  that are loaded by systemd and passed to localslackirc-
