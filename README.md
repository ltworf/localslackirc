localslackirc
=============

[THE PROJECT IS NOW ON CODEBERG!](https://codeberg.org/ltworf/localslackirc)


The idea of this project is to create a localhost IRC server that functions as
a gateway for one user of slack, that can connect to it with whatever IRC
client they prefer or a bouncer like ZNC and keep using slack from IRC even
after they shut down their IRC gateway.

Why? Peace of mind!
-------------------

Using slack from IRC instead of web app offers several advantages:

* You do not see all the gifs other people post.
* You can silence @here notifications for selected users and channels where they
  are abused.
* You can `/ignore` users who bother you (can't do that on slack).
* Leaving channels on slack is hard, normally I get invited back continuously
  on the off topic channels. With *localslackirc* you can leave them on the IRC
  client without people knowing that you won't be reading any of that.
* IRC clients allow to customise notifications. For example I have set mine to
  just blink in the tray area and do no sounds or popups.
* Any IRC client is faster than the web ui slack has, and it will respect your
  colour and style settings.
* Power savings. Because that's a logical consequence of not doing something
  in the browser.
