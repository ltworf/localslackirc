localslackirc
=============

The idea of this project is to create a localhost IRC server that
functions as a gateway for one user of slack, that can connect
to it with whatever IRC client they prefer or a bouncer like
ZNC and keep using slack from IRC even after they shut down
their IRC gateway.


Options to Obtain token
===============

* Retrieve a slack token from https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens

Alternatively if this method fails you can get one from Slack's web client

1) Instructions for chromium

* In your browser, go to "Inspect" (developer mode) on an empty page
* Select the "Network" tab.
* Select WS (WebSockets)
* Open your web slack client
* Copy the 'token' parameter from the WebSocket connection URL. [Picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inariksit/localslackirc/master/doc/token-instructions.png)


2) Instructions for firefox

* In your browser, open the Slack web client
* Press F12 to open the developer tools
* Refresh the page (F5)
* Select the 'Network' tab
* Select the 'WS' tab
* Copy the 'token' parameter from the WebSocket connection URL.



Using Token
===========

Your Slack token should be placed inside a file named '.localslackirc' (note the file starts with a . and has no file extension) inside your home directory. On a Linux/BSD machine your home directory will be located at /home/yourusername, on OSX it is /Users/yourusername and on a Windows machine it is C:\Users\yourusername. 

If you'd prefer to store your token elsewhere you can open localslackirc with the '-t' argument giving it the new desired location. ```python3 irc.py -t /home/me/slack/token.txt``` 

Using localslackirc
===================

* Start localslackirc by running `python3 irc.py` - you should see a connection message similar to the this:
```
{'ok': True, 'url': 'wss://cerberus-xxxx.lb.slack-msgs.com/websocket/jhvbT8578765JHBfrewgsdy7', 'team': {'id': 'ZZZ789012', 'name': 'Some Team', 'domain': 'someteam'}, 'self': {'id': 'XXX123456', 'name': 'your name'}}
```

 
* Now point your irc client to localslackirc (127.0.0.1:9007)
  * login to localslackirc using your Slack username
  * after your connected, list the channels in your irc client and select the ones you want to join. 

## Automatically joining channels
To automatically connect to the Slack channels you are in open localslackirc with the -j argument
```python3 irc.py -j```

## Instructions for irssi

If you need to refresh your memory about connecting in general, this is a good guide: https://pthree.org/2010/02/02/irssis-channel-network-server-and-connect-what-it-means/

Here's a list of irssi commands to set up a network and a localhost server:

```
/network add -user <you> -realname "<your name>" -nick <your nick> <slackname>
/server add -auto -port 9007 -network <slackname> localhost
/save
```

Then, start localslackirc in your terminal if you haven't already. (Just type `python3 irc.py`).

After localslackirc is running, and you have seen the connection
message seen above, you can just connect to the localhost IRC network
in irssi. Like this:

```
/connect <slackname>
```

And you should see the following message in your irssi:
```
22:15:35 [<slackname>] -!- Irssi: Looking up localhost
22:15:35 [<slackname>] -!- Irssi: Connecting to localhost [127.0.0.1] port 9007
22:15:35 [<slackname>] -!- Irssi: Connection to localhost established
22:15:36 [<slackname>] -!- Hi, welcome to IRC
22:15:36 [<slackname>] -!- Your host is serenity, running version miniircd-1.2.1
22:15:36 [<slackname>] -!- This server was created sometime
22:15:36 [<slackname>] -!- serenity miniircd-1.2.1 o o
22:15:36 [<slackname>] -!- There are 1 users and 0 services on 1 server
...
```

Requirements
============

* At least Python 3.6
* The modules indicated in `requirements.txt`


Using a docker container to run localslackirc
=============================================

Inside `docker` directory there is a dockerfile to generate a container that runs `localslackirc`.
In order to use it follow the instructions:

```
# docker build -t localslackirc -f docker/Dockerfile .

```

If everything went fine you should have a new container running localslackirc.

To start your new container:

```
docker run -d -p 9007:9007 --name=mylocalslackirc -e 'SLACKTOKEN=MYSLACKTOKEN' localslackirc
```
