# Example configuration file for localslackirc.
#
# The instances are to be launched with:
#
# systemctl start localslackirc@filename.service
#
# filename must be replaced with the filename of the
# configuration file in /etc/localslackirc.d
#
# Make sure that the file is not world readable, since
# it contains the access token.
#
# To start the instance at every boot
# sudo systemctl enable localslackirc@filename.service


# The port to listen to, for the IRC client to connect to
#PORT=9007

# The token string
#TOKEN=xxxx

# The cookie string (Not always needed)
#COOKIE=xxxx

# The user that will be used to run this process.
# Using nobody is fine, but it might be desirable to
# change this to be able to send files which might not
# be readable otherwise
#PROCESS_OWNER=nobody

# Auto join channels
AUTOJOIN=true

#IP_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
